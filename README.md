**Test-Blazor-MLNet-WASMHost**
is a test Blazor WASM and .NET 5 application that shows howto perform Machine Learning .NET inference locally inside the browser.

**Live Demo Web Site (ASP.NET Host - Azure App Service):** https://test-blazor-mlnet.azurewebsites.net/  
**Live Demo Web Site (Static Website Host - Azure Static Websites):** https://mlnetandblazor.azureedge.net/

**Technologies Used:** Blazor WASM (WebAssembly), C#, ML.NET NuGet Package for ML, Blazor Typeahead for filtering, D3.js for visualizations

**Note:** Both sites work on mobile devices with enough RAM. Early 2018 phone models should work. For example, iPhone 8 Plus will give a stack memory error iPhone X, 11 and 12 will work fine.
